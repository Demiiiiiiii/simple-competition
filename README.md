# simple-competition

In this final project, you will develop a program called SimpleCompetitions. This program helps companies (e.g., retailers) create competitions to boost their sales. For instance, during the Easter Sale, a retailer can use your software to create a lucky draw game. In the game, a customer is given entries equivalent to the size of its purchase after their single-purchase final balance, after discounts, reach a specific amount, say $50. Once the competition time ends, the retailer draws winners and the winning customers will get points added to their membership account; customers can use these points for future purchases if they wish. Please read the competition policy and application walk-through sections for more information. This final project is designed in such a way that we can evaluate your knowledge on all important topics you have learnt in this subject: 1) class design and implementation, 2) control flow structures (e.g., if-then-else & switch-case statements, loops), 3) basic I/O (e.g., Scanner class, formatted printing), 4) arrays, 5) inheritance & polymorphism, 6) exception handling, and 7) file I/O.
